### List of specific actions we need to do on k8s
- hostkey/hostcert.pem files with hostname matching k8s host should reside in
  frontend configureation area
- for reqmgr2 we need to use pycurl that's why its install script perform the
  patch of the code to use it, otherwise default httplib2 library fails to
  pass requests from reqmgr2 to couchdb
- we need to use hostNetwork to allow communication between
  reqmgr2/reqmon/workqueue and couch (this option is presented in their yaml
  files)
- nginx ingress controller must access tls.key and tls.crt files while it is
  deployed, these files reside in ing secrets file. These files should have
  certificate matching k8s hostname
- robot certificates should be generated by CERN representative via
  ca.cern.ch They will be used to generate proxy and used by cervices to
  pass requests to the cluster
